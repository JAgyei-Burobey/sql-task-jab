5. What is the description of the movie with an ID of 100?
SELECT description FROM film where film_id = 100
-- Output shows the description of the film with an id of 100.
-- The description is 'A Beautiful Drama of a Dentist And a Composer who must Battle a Sumo Wrestler in The First Manned Space Station'



I had the idea of how to do number 4, but I had to google the code. 
I knew that I needed to find a way to separate every 10th id, and this line of code does it well.
However, the output only stays correct so long as there are no gaps in the numbering/no rows have been deleted.

1. List all actors.
SELECT * FROM actor;
-- Output displays the entire list of actors, with columns: actor_id; first_name; last_name; last_update.
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor
-- Output displays the entire list of actors, but only with comums first_name and last_name.


2.Find the surname of the actor with the forename 'John'.
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE first_name = 'JOHN';
-- Output displays every actor with first_name matching 'JOHN'.
-- The surname is 'SUVARI'.


3. Find all actors with surname 'Neeson'.
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE last_name = 'NEESON';
-- Output displays every actor with last_name matching 'NEESON'.
-- The actors are 'CHRISTIAN', 'JAYNE'.


4. Find all actors with ID numbers divisible by 10.
SELECT * FROM actor WHERE MOD(actor_id,10)=0;
-- Output displays every id divided by 10 with a remainder equal to 0.


5. What is the description of the movie with an ID of 100?
SELECT description FROM film where film_id = 100
-- Output shows the description of the film with an id of 100.
-- The description is 'A Beautiful Drama of a Dentist And a Composer who must Battle a Sumo Wrestler in The First Manned Space Station'

______________
I had the idea of how to do number 4, but I had to google the code. 
I knew that I needed to find a way to separate every 10th id, and this line of code does it well.
However, the output only stays correct so long as there are no gaps in the numbering/no rows have been deleted.

6. Find every R-rated movie.
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating = 'R'
-- Output displays every row in film where the rating is 'R'.


7. Find every non-R-rated movie.
SELECT * FROM film WHERE rating != 'R'
-- Output displays every row in film where the rating is not 'R'.


8. Find the ten shortest movies.
SELECT * FROM film ORDER BY length ASC LIMIT 10;
-- Output displays 10 rows with the smallest (shortest) length in film in ascending order.


9. Find the movies with the longest runtime, without using LIMIT.
SELECT * FROM film WHERE length = 185
-- Output displays every row in film where length = 185 (max value in length in 185)


10. Find all movies that have deleted scenes.
SELECT * FROM film WHERE special_features LIKE '%Deleted Scenes'
-- Output displays every row in film which has '%Deleted Scenes' in the special_features column.


___________________
I had a LOT of trouble with #9. 
I thought the MAX() function is used to identify the rows with the highest value in a column.
But I couldn't get that to work.
So I listed every row in descending order of length.
Then I identified the highest value was 185.
So I simply found each row with length equal to 185.
